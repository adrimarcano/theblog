    Hello! My name is Adriana and welcome to my blog. This is a personal space in which I´ll be sharing some personal aspects of my life so you can get to know me. From hobbies, to background and future aspirations. However, this is only a brief recap of my life, so if you want to be friends and learn a litte bit more about me scroll down!

          <h2> MY BACKGROUND: WHO AM I AND WHERE AM I FROM? </h2>
    <p>I am 22 years old girl born and raised in Caracas,Venezuela. Due to the political and social situation I left the country when I was 17 years old. My first destination after leaving my country was the United States, where I did my last year of high school. When that ended I moved to Madrid, Spain for college. I've been living there for almost 4 years now but I'm currently in France for six months.

    <h2> MY HOBBIES: WHAT DO I LIKE TO DO? </h2>
      <p> I love doing what regular people do on their free time. I like doing exercise (yoga,cycling, hiking,lifting weights, going for a walk,etc), going out with my friends, reading, watching movies, documentaries, listening to music, traveling, baking, playing the piano, among many other things. However, I would have to say that my main hobby is spending time with my dogs, either going for a run/walk with them or taking them to the park.

    <h2> THE FUTURE: PROFESSIONAL </h2>
      <p> As I told you before, I have one year left until graduation and I´m not completely sure what I want to do with my life, I´m still deciding my career path but I´d love to work in a marketing-related atmosphere where I can apply everything I learned throughout college. However, in order to be entirely sure that´s what I want to do I still have a Master´s degree and some internships ahead of me.

  <div class="card-white">
    <h2> THE FUTURE: PERSONAL </h2>
      <p> In the personal area my expectations are different. After graduation, I would really like to take some time to travel and get to know as many places and people as possible. Additionally, I would like to open a dog shelter, so stray dogs can have a forever home. I would like to work remotely in the future so I don´t have to physically be in only one place. Life is too short and we never know how much time we have here so we might as well create memories with people that we care about.
